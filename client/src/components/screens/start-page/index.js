                        We present to you an interactive map of Europe, on which you can observe several companies and analyze their impact on the environment. We used a dataset that showed how much COâ‚‚ companies of different fields emit. Using another dataset with sales we calculated the total amount of co2 companies produced versus the money they earned. This graphical data give us a better understanding of how much we contaminate the planet. Additionally, you can read facts and environmental advice that were gathered from proven sources. Potential shareholders will be able to form a rough understanding of fields and make their comparisons.
